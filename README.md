## AWS SAM
[AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/deploying-lambda-apps.html) extends AWS CloudFormation to provide a simplified way of defining the Amazon API Gateway APIs, AWS Lambda functions, and Amazon DynamoDB tables needed by your serverless application.

You can use AWS CloudFormation to specify, deploy, and configure serverless applications. AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up your AWS resources so that you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your applications that run in AWS.

The AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) is a model to define serverless applications. AWS SAM is natively supported by AWS CloudFormation and defines simplified syntax for expressing serverless resources. The specification currently covers APIs, Lambda functions and Amazon DynamoDB tables.

## AWS SAM Open Source
The goal of [AWS SAM](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model) is to define a standard application model for serverless applications.
