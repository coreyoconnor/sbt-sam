# Updating a lambda function code
Source: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-lambda-function-code.html

```
To update a Lambda function whose source code is in an Amazon S3 bucket, 
you must trigger an update by updating the S3Bucket, S3Key, or S3ObjectVersion property. 
Updating the source code alone doesn't update the function.
